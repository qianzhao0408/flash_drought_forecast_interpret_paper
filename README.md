## Overview
IT-Drought model extends [our previous work](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/35066) in [the repository](https://github.com/osu-srml/DroughtSet.git), with several modifications to provide near-real-time forecasting of soil moisture and interpret its predictability and climatic drivers on flash droughts.<br>
<br>
This repository includes codes for pre-processing input data, identifying flash droughts, and calculating forecast skill metrics.<br>
<br>
The expected runtime for the contiguous U.S. is approximately two days for training and four days for interpretation. The steps are as follows:<br>
1. Download model data from zenodo <br>
2. Download and prepare
3.
